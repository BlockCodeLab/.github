西摩·佩珀特（Seymour Papert）的思想和发明改变了全世界数百万儿童创作和学习的方式，他于周日（2016年7月31日）在缅因州东蓝山的家中去世。享年88岁。

儿童发展学、人工智能和教育技术共同谱写了帕珀特职业生涯的三重奏。基于他对儿童思考行为和学习过程的洞察，佩珀特认识到，计算机不仅可以提供信息和指导，还可以帮助儿童去尝试、去探索和自我表达。他的“建构主义”（Constructionist）学习理论的核心原则是，人在积极构建周围环境事物时才能最有效地建立知识积累。早在 1968 年，帕帕特就提出，编程和调试的实践可以为儿童提供一种反思自己思维方式并理解自己学习过程的途径。

麻省理工学院校长拉斐尔·雷夫（L. Rafael Reif）说：“凭借非凡的思想和创造力，西摩·佩珀特至少为三个领域带来了革命性的变化，从研究儿童如何认识世界，到人工智能的发展，再到技术与学习的交融。他给麻省理工学院留下了深邃的印记。今天，麻省理工学院在数字教育领域的影响持续扩大、研究不断深入，我要着重感谢西摩开创性的远见，我们希望在他的思想之上，为全世界所有年龄段的学习者提供更多的可能性。”

佩珀特的一生辗转几大洲。他于1928年出生于南非比勒陀利亚，后进入南非威特沃特斯兰德大学学习，1949年获得哲学学士学位，三年后又获得数学博士学位。大学期间，他一直是反种族隔离运动的激进分子。

1954年至1958年，帕珀特前往英国剑桥大学深造，在那里他专注于数学研究，并获得了第二个博士学位；之后，他又前往日内瓦大学，与瑞士哲学家和心理学家让·皮亚杰共事，皮亚杰关于儿童如何认识世界的理论改变了帕珀特对儿童和学习的看法。

1963 年，佩珀特从瑞士来到美国，进入麻省理工学院担任助理研究员。四年后，他成为应用数学系的教授，不久又被人工智能实验室（后来发展成为计算机科学与人工智能实验室，简称 CSAIL）的创始主任马文·明斯基教授任命为该实验室的联席主任。1969 年，他们共同撰写了《感知器》（Perceptrons）一书，此书也成为了人工智能领域的关键节点。

1985 年，佩珀特和明斯基同作为创始成员，加入了麻省理工学院前校长杰罗姆·威斯纳及麻省理工学院教授尼古拉斯·尼葛洛庞帝新成立的媒体实验室（Media Lab），佩珀特在该实验室领导认识论与学习研究小组（Epistemology and Learning research group）。

媒体实验室的联合创始人兼首任主任尼葛洛庞帝说：“西摩的话语经常充满诗意，有时还喜欢打哑谜，比如他那句著名的’如果不思考一些事情，就无法思考思维本身’。他不循规蹈矩，也不按别人的时间表行事。如果让我用帕帕特式的话语形容他，我会说西摩从来不需要言出必行，因为在他说话的功夫，事情往往有了更好的进展。”

佩珀特是最早一批认识到计算机在教育领域革命性潜力的人。20世纪60年代末，当计算机的价格还高达数十万美元时，佩珀特就想出了Logo，这是第一款为儿童设计的编程语言。孩子们用 Logo对“海龟”的动作进行编程，“海龟”既可以是实体的小机器人，也可以是计算机屏幕上的图形对象。在他的开创性著作《因计算机而强大》（Mindstorms：Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas》（1980 年）一书中，佩珀特反对 “计算机被用来给儿童编程”。他提出了另一种视角， “是儿童在对计算机进行编程，在此过程中，他们既收获了对最现代、最强大的技术的掌控感，又与科学、数学以及构建知识模型方面最底层的概念形成了紧密连接”。

佩珀特与麻省理工学院科学社会研究系的“艾比-洛克菲勒-莫泽教授”（the Abby Rockefeller Mauzé Professor）雪莉-特克尔（Sherry Turkle）合作，探讨了孩提时代的物品如何对深刻影响着儿童的学习方式和学习内容。在《因计算机而强大》一书中，佩珀特解释了他小时候是如何 “爱上齿轮”的，以及他是希望以何种方式“让计算机成为足够灵活的工具，使得每个孩子都能像我用齿轮做些小玩意儿那样用它为自己创造些东西”。

1974年至1981年，佩珀特担任麻省理工学院“塞西尔和艾达-格林教育学教授”（the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Education）。1985 年，他与乐高公司开始了长期且富有成效的合作，乐高公司是最早为媒体实验室提供大量赞助的企业之一。佩珀特的想法也成为乐高头脑风暴（Mindstorms）机器人套件的灵感来源，套件直接以他1980年的著作命名。1989 年，乐高公司在媒体实验室赞助了一个教席，佩珀特成为第一位“乐高学习研究教授”（LEGO Professor of Learning Research）。1998 年，在帕珀特成为名誉教授后，为了纪念他，教席的名称改为“乐高帕珀特学习研究教授”（the LEGO Papert Professorship of Learning Research）。教授职位传给了佩珀特昔日的学生和长期合作者米切尔·雷斯尼克（Mitchel Resnick），由他继续担任至今。

“对于我们很多人来说，西摩从根本上改变了我们对学习、对儿童以及对科技的看法，”媒体实验室终身幼儿园研究小组负责人雷斯尼克说。

20 世纪 90 年代末，佩珀特搬到了缅因州，继续在那里从事青少年教育工作，并于 1999 年建立了“学习谷仓”（Learning Barn）和西摩·佩珀特研究所（The Seymour Papert Institution）。他还在“缅因州青少年中心”（Maine Youth Center，一个类似于少管所的机构）建立了学习实验室，致力于干预和激励那些在家庭或学校几乎得不到支持，正在与毒品、酗酒、愤怒或心理问题斗争的问题青少年。他还全力支持了要求缅因州政府为所有七、八年级学生配备笔记本电脑的法案。在此之后，2004 年，佩珀特与尼葛洛庞帝和艾伦·凯（Alan Kay）共同创建了非营利组织 “每个孩子一台笔记本电脑”（OLPC，One Laptop per Child），为世界上最贫困的儿童生产和分发低成本、低功耗、坚固耐用的笔记本电脑。该组织生产了 300 多万台笔记本电脑，惠及 40 多个国家的儿童。尼葛洛庞帝说：“每台笔记本电脑里都有西摩的努力。”

佩珀特的工作激励了全世界几代教育工作者和研究人员。他获奖无数，包括1980年古根海姆学者奖、1981年马可尼国际奖学金和1997年《计算机世界》颁发的史密森尼奖。2001年，《新闻周刊》将他评为 “全美十大教育创新人物 ”之一。

1972年接任人工智能实验室主任的CSAIL的帕特里克·温斯顿（Patrick Winston）说：“佩珀特通过鼓励人们着眼于全局，专注于强有力的思想，让他身边的每个人——无论孩子或是同事——都变得更加聪明。”

除了《因计算机而强大》，佩珀特还是《儿童机器》（The Children’s Machine，1993 年）和《互联家庭》： 弥合数字代沟》（The Connected Family: Bridging the Digital Generation Gap，1996 年）的作者。退休之后，佩珀特继续撰写了许多文章，并在基于科技的教育（technology-based education）方面向世界各国政府提供建议。2006 年，他前往越南参加数学教育会议，在河内被一辆摩托车撞倒，脑部严重受伤。

佩珀特的妻子苏珊娜-马西（Suzanne Massie）是一位俄罗斯学者，与他合作开展了 “学习谷仓”等多个国际项目；女儿阿尔忒弥斯·佩珀特（Artemis Papert）；三个继子女罗伯特·马西四世（Robert Massie IV）、苏珊娜·马西·托马斯（Susanna Massie Thomas）和伊丽莎白·马西（Elizabeth Massie）；以及两个兄弟姐妹艾伦·佩珀特（Alan Papert）和琼·佩珀特（Joan Papert）。他曾与多娜·施特劳斯（Dona Strauss）、安德鲁拉·克里斯托菲迪斯·亨里克斯（Androula Christofides Henriques）以及雪莉·特克尔（Sherry Turkle）结婚。

## Professor Emeritus Seymour Papert, pioneer of constructionist learning, dies at 88

**Written By**: MIT Media Lab, August 1, 2016

Seymour Papert, whose ideas and inventions transformed how millions of children around the world create and learn, died Sunday at his home in East Blue Hill, Maine. He was 88.

Papert’s career traversed a trio of influential movements: child development, artificial intelligence, and educational technologies. Based on his insights into children’s thinking and learning, Papert recognized that computers could be used not just to deliver information and instruction, but also to empower children to experiment, explore, and express themselves. The central tenet of his Constructionist theory of learning is that people build knowledge most effectively when they are actively engaged in constructing things in the world. As early as 1968, Papert introduced the idea that computer programming and debugging can provide children a way to think about their own thinking and learn about their own learning.

“With a mind of extraordinary range and creativity, Seymour Papert helped revolutionize at least three fields, from the study of how children make sense of the world, to the development of artificial intelligence, to the rich intersection of technology and learning,” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “The stamp he left on MIT is profound. Today, as MIT continues to expand its reach and deepen its work in digital learning, I am particularly grateful for Seymour’s groundbreaking vision, and we hope to build on his ideas to open doors to learners of all ages, around the world.”

Papert’s life straddled several continents. He was born in 1928 in Pretoria, South Africa, and went on to study at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, where he earned a BA in philosophy in 1949, followed by a PhD in mathematics three years later. He was a leading anti-apartheid activist throughout his university years.

Papert’s studies then took him overseas – first to Cambridge University in England from 1954-1958, where he focused on math research, earning his second PhD, then to the University of Geneva, where he worked with Swiss philosopher and psychologist Jean Piaget, whose theories about the ways children make sense of the world changed Papert’s view of children and learning.

From Switzerland, Papert came to the U.S., joining MIT as a research associate in 1963. Four years later, he became a professor of applied mathematics, and shortly after was appointed co-director of the Artificial Intelligence Lab (which later evolved into the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, or CSAIL) by its founding director Professor Marvin Minsky. Together, they wrote the 1969 book, “Perceptrons,” which marked a turning point in the field of artificial intelligence.

In 1985, Papert and Minsky joined former MIT President Jerome Wiesner and MIT Professor Nicholas Negroponte to become founding faculty members of the MIT Media Lab, where Papert led the Epistemology and Learning research group.

“Seymour often talked poetically, sometimes in riddles, like his famed phrase, ‘you cannot think about thinking without thinking about thinking about something,’” says Negroponte, the Media Lab’s co-founder and first director. “He did not follow rules or run by anybody else’s clock. I would say, in Papertian style, Seymour never needed to do what he said because when he said what he did, it was better.”

Papert was among the first to recognize the revolutionary potential of computers in education. In the late 1960s, at a time when computers still cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, Papert came up with the idea for Logo, the first programming language for children. Children used Logo to program the movements of a “turtle” — either in the form of a small mechanical robot or a graphic object on the computer screen. In his seminal book “Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas” (1980), Papert argued against “the computer being used to program the child.” He presented an alternative approach in which “the child programs the computer and, in doing so, both acquires a sense of mastery over a piece of the most modern and powerful technology and establishes an intimate contact with some of the deepest ideas from science, from mathematics, and from the art of intellectual model building.”

In collaboration with Sherry Turkle, the Abby Rockefeller Mauzé Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at MIT, Papert explored how childhood objects have a deep influence on how and what children learn. In “Mindstorms,” Papert explained how he “fell in love with gears” as a child, and how he hoped to “turn computers into instruments flexible enough so that many children can each create for themselves something like what the gears were for me.”

Papert was the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Education at MIT from 1974-1981. In 1985, he began a long and productive collaboration with the LEGO company, one of the first and largest corporate sponsors of the Media Lab. Papert’s ideas served as an inspiration for the LEGO Mindstorms robotics kit, which was named after his 1980 book. In 1989, the LEGO company endowed a chair at the Media Lab, and Papert became the first LEGO Professor of Learning Research. In 1998, after Papert became professor emeritus, the name of the professorship was modified, in his honor, to the LEGO Papert Professorship of Learning Research. The professorship was passed on to Papert’s former student and long-time collaborator, Mitchel Resnick, who continues to hold the chair today.

“For so many of us, Seymour fundamentally changed the way we think about learning, the way we think about children, and the way we think about technology,” says Resnick, who heads the Media Lab’s Lifelong Kindergarten research group.

In the late 1990s, Papert moved to Maine and continued his work with young people there, establishing the Learning Barn and the Seymour Papert Institute in 1999. He also set up a Learning Lab at the Maine Youth Center, where he worked to engage and inspire troubled youths who had received little support at home or school, and were grappling with drugs, alcohol, anger, or psychological problems. He was also integral to a Maine initiative requiring laptops for all 7th and 8th graders. Following the Maine initiative, Papert joined Negroponte and Alan Kay in 2004 to create the non-profit One Laptop per Child (OLPC), which produced and distributed low-cost, low-power, rugged laptops to the world’s poorest children. The organization produced more than 3 million laptops, reaching children in more than 40 countries. “Each of the laptops has Seymour inside,” says Negroponte.

Papert’s work inspired generations of educators and researchers around the world. He received numerous awards, including a Guggenheim fellowship in 1980, a Marconi International fellowship in 1981, and the Smithsonian Award from Computerworld in 1997. In 2001, Newsweek named him “one of the nation’s 10 top innovators in education.”

“Papert made everyone around him smarter — from children to colleagues — by encouraging people to focus on the big picture and zero in on the powerful ideas,” says CSAIL’s Patrick Winston, who took over as director of the AI Lab in 1972.

In addition to “Mindstorms,” Papert was the author of “The Children’s Machine” (1993) and “The Connected Family: Bridging the Digital Generation Gap” (1996). As an emeritus professor, Papert continued to write many articles and advise governments around the world on technology-based education. In 2006, while in Vietnam for a conference on mathematics education, he suffered a serious brain injury when struck by a motor scooter in Hanoi.

Papert is survived by his wife of 24 years, Suzanne Massie, a Russia scholar with whom he collaborated on the Learning Barn and many international projects; his daughter, Artemis Papert; three stepchildren, Robert Massie IV, Susanna Massie Thomas, and Elizabeth Massie; and two siblings, Alan Papert and Joan Papert. He was previously married to Dona Strauss, Androula Christofides Henriques, and Sherry Turkle.

The Media Lab will host a celebration of the life and work of Seymour Papert in the coming months.
